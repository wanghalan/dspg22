## What is a Data Commons?
Data commons is an open knowledge repository that co-locates data from a variety of sources, builds and curates data insights, and provides tools designed to track issues over time and geography allowing governments and community stakeholders to learn continuously from their own data.

The Social and Decision Analytics Division has already deployed several data commons to empower policymakers with easy access to data analysis and visualizations. One example is the [Virginia Department of Health Data Commons](https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/vdh_rural_health_site/).

Local communities have data on policies, strategies, events, and social behaviors but often lack the analytical tools to use their valuable data. Partnering with the **Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth**, we hope to equip local communities in the National Capital Region with easy access to analytical tools like this to drive policy and strategy development.

## Cost of Living Calculator

One important section of our data commons is the proportion of households at risk of food insecurity in each region. To make a reliable estimation of households at risk, we need a trustworthy calculator for the cost of living in each corresponding region. A cost-of-living adjustment is important because it allows employees, retirees and people living on fixed incomes to afford housing, goods, services and taxes as prices increase over time.The cost of living is often used to compare how expensive it is to live in one city versus another. To account for sub-county level variations in cost of living, the geographic resolution we target is at census-tract level. According to the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_13), a census tract is 

### Comparisons of Existing Calculators
We started our process by comparing three cost of living calculators

They are
- Economic Policy institute(EPI)
- MIT living Wage Calculator
- Washington Self Sufficiency (CFWW)

We analyzed data sources in each calculator and found out the best source

We took those different sources, merged them and proposed a new calculator

### Our Sources
There are various categories that a calculator have to take into consideration for estimating the Cost of living in a particular area. 

#### Categories
The categories in a calculator can be classified as

-Food

-Housing

-Transportation

-Child care

-Medical

-Miscellaneous

-Tax

-Credit


The following picture shows the **Methodology Summary** of our proposed Cost of Living Calculator

-Our Methodology Summary provides information about various categories present in a cost of living calculator with a description of their **calculation** process

-**Source** section indicates the **data source** 

-**User** section indicates which calculator uses that source

-**Level** of data indicates level of the data like county, tract or zip code level. 

### Examples from Fairfax County, VA

We took three **cesus tracts** from the Fairfax county and tried to calculate the cost of living for a number of hosueholds  and calculated who are food insecure according to our cost of living calculator. We tried it out with various combinations of households ranging from HH1 to HH7.
