## Introduction: What is a Data Commons?
Data commons is an open knowledge repository that co-locates data from a variety of sources, builds and curates data insights, and provides tools designed to track issues over time and geography allowing governments and community stakeholders to learn continuously from their own data.

The Social and Decision Analytics Division has already deployed several data commons to empower policymakers with easy access to data analysis and visualizations. One example is the [Virginia Department of Health Data Commons](https://uva-bi-sdad.github.io/vdh_rural_health_site/).

Local communities have data on policies, strategies, events, and social behaviors but often lack the analytical tools to use their valuable data. Partnering with the **Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth**, we hope to equip local communities with easy access to analytical tools like this to drive policy and strategy development.
