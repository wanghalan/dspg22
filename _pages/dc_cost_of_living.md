Partnering with the **Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth**, we hope to equip local communities in the National Capital Region with easy access to analytical tools like this to drive policy and strategy development.

## Cost of Living Calculator

One important section of our data commons is the proportion of households at risk of food insecurity in each region. To make a reliable estimation of households at risk, we need a trustworthy calculator for the cost of living in each corresponding region. To account for sub-county level variations in cost of living, the geographic resolution we target is at census-tract level. According to the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_13), a census tract is 

### Comparisons of Existing Calculators

They are

- MIT living Wage Calculator
_ Washing Self Sufficiency (CFWW)
